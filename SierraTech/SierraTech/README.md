# SierraTech



## Description

This mod expands on and improves the techtree and recipe production chains post-Sierra, in particular addressing oversights, annoyances and deficiencies in vanilla.
It also provides several technologies and recipe chains to enable high-complexity high-reward infrastructure, as well as to enable sustainable production of some resources not otherwise reasonably possible to maintain in perpetuity.

## Notes

* New games must be loaded, saved, and reloaded for mods to take effect.
* This mod, as always, is "use at your own risk". Even under the best of circumstances, let alone cases like incorrect installs or unintentional mod errors, save files become dependent on and can be corrupted by mods used within.
* While the author of this mod owns all copyright of its custom code, Fire Hose games owns Techtonica and all code and assets therein, and assets derived from Techtonica assets are not solely the creation or property of the mod author.
